This is a reupload of my yearly final project.

The aim of this work was to create a mobile Android application for managing job offers in the IT sector. 
This application allows people to offer their skills or to find other users job offers using a graphical user interface. 
Each user can create their own offers, which other users will be able to view and order. When ordering, the user enters 
specific requirements for the selling user. After sending the order, the selling user has the option to 
accept or reject the order. In the application, users can contact each other through messages in the application

This app will not work if you just download it.
